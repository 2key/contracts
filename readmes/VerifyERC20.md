### How to verify ERC20 token 


Since ERC20 is just a standard for the token, and every token 
can have different code behind it, leading to different bytecodes,
this article will explain how to verify ERC20 compliant tokens created through 2key app.


##### Registration
You must have a registered account on https://etherscan.io

##### Start verification
You should go to https://etherscan.io/verifyContract?a=<PUT_YOUR_ADDRESS_HERE>
For example if your address = 0x0EED754f794369b9473A4d93705fA31c7E464ee3 then the URL will look like : 
- https://etherscan.io/verifyContract?a=0x0EED754f794369b9473A4d93705fA31c7E464ee3
