## Usage
* The application starts by displaying all contracts you either created or joined to.
* Information appears in tables, each row describes a different contract. Use the tooltips of the column names to understand each one of them.
* Some of the values displayed in the tables appear as buttons. Use their tooltips to understand what action will happen if you click on them.
For example, the buttons in the values for the following columns:
  * `name` - switch you into a single view for that contract.
  * `my 2key link` - copy to clipboard a shortened 2key link for the contract.
  If you paste the link in a browser you will also move into the single view display.
  You can use the link as a shortcut to your contract and the link can also 
  be used by other users to join the contract, in this case you will want to
  first logout before opening the link.
* Single contract view displayes a visual graph of the influencers and customers
 that used your 2key link directly or indirectly. If non exist then the graph will not be displayed.
 The contractor (root node, the creator of the contract) appears as a red circle.
 Converters (customers) appear as green circles and the path from them to the root is also colored green.
 For every node you can collapse/expand the nodes below it by clicking on it. When collapsed the node appears with gray interior.
 Each node has a tooltip with how much units it bought and how many customers it converted.


## 2key Tokens
* Each user can own 2key tokens.
* At first the only account that has 2key tokens is `coinbase`.
* You can login to this account and transfer some of your tokens to another user
* or you can approve another user to later take some of the tokens himself
* you can know how much someone allowed you to transfer
* and then you can transfer from that someone some or all of the allowed tokens
